This repo contains a data structure for storing multiple data types in a single array container in cpp. 

- For Linux users, run `g++ --version` to check the g++ compiler version. If it's version 7 or later, your compiler likely supports C++17. Otherwise, update gcc.
- Try online [here](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler), select C++17 as the compiler.
- In Windows, to run this cpp program, you must have a compiler supporting c++17 features. The following link given [here](http://candcplusplus.com/enable-c17-in-code-blocks-mingw-gcc-for-all-version-with-pictures ) is a keyway to downloading the updated compiler and enabling necessary compiler supports in Code::Blocks.
